ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope, you can use import instead
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/Users/ryanvu/Repos/calhacks_project/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
